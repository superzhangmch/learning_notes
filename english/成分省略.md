>
> that可 以单独引导结果状语从句，不一定有so….that 或 such…that 的搭配。当 that 单独出现引导状语从句时，有时会考验读者的语感判断。读者需要警惕that 的这种用法，并从句子的语境来判断that是否采用了这种用法。
> 1. 由that引导的状语从句。
>    - What have I done **that** you should treat me like this? 我究竟干了什么，你竟这样对待我？
>    - Sugar poses **enough** health risks **that** it should be considered a controlled substance just like alcohol and tobacco. 糖造成很大的健康危害，所以应该像控制烟酒一样来控制糖。
> 2. 结果状语从句中的that 有时还可以省列。
>    - He is **such** a marvelous joker **(省that)**you can't help laughing. 他的笑话讲得那么出色，你会禁不住哈哈大笑。
> 
> 从结构的角度讲，区分that是引导状语从句还是引导定语从句可以根椐从句的成分是否完整来判断。定语从句通常是不完整的，即从句所修饰的先行词会在从句中充当某成分。如: It is a story that people believe. 这是一个人们都相信的故事。(这里 story 作believe 的宾语。)
