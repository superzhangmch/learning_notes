On a dark desert highway cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air      # 空气中弥漫着大麻花蕾的温暖香气。在加州、墨西哥一带的俚语中，“colitas” 常指大麻植株顶端的小花蕾 —— 也就是大麻中最浓香、最具效力的部分。
Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light    # up ahead：在前方；in the distance：在远处、在远方；shimmering：闪烁的、闪闪发光的、微微发亮的
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell                             # mission bell：传教堂的钟声。传教堂是指由传教士（missionary）建立的 用于传播宗教信仰的教堂与驻地。
And I was thinking to myself
This could be Heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Such a lovely face
Plenty of rooms at the Hotel California
Any time of year you can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted                         # “Tiffany”是奢侈珠宝品牌，twisted 表示被扭曲的；意为“被物质欲望扭曲的心灵”。
She got the Mercedes Benz                           # Mercedes Benz：奔驰汽车
She got a lot of pretty pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat                                  # 夏日甜蜜的汗水
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain                          # captain：指的服务员或酒吧经理
Please bring me my wine
He said
We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine
And still those voices are calling from far away    # 而那些声音依然从远方传来呼唤
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
They living it up at the Hotel California           # live it up 是一个非常常见的英语口语短语：“尽情享乐、纵情狂欢、尽情享受生活”
What nice surprise
What nice surprise
Bring your alibis                                   # alibi /ˈælɪbaɪ/ n. 不在场证明；借口；托词。这里指“任何为了推脱或掩饰的借口”。
Mirrors on the ceiling
Pink champagne on ice
She said
We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device                                   # “出自我们自己设计的（陷阱）”，也就是——我们自己造成的局面。我们都只是被自己设计困住的囚徒
In the master's chambers                            # master：象征“控制我们灵魂的力量”
They gathered for the feast
They stabbed it with their steely knives            # stabbed the beast，it==beast。他们用钢刀刺，但就是杀不死那头野兽
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage Back
To the place I was before
“Relax,” said the night man,                       # night man 表面上是 夜班管理员 / 夜间值班人（旅馆前台夜班经理）。但象征上，他代表的是 这个幻境或系统的守门人——
“We are programmed to receive.                     # 只能接收（receive），不能放行（leave）。
You can check out any time you like,
But you can never leave.”
```
