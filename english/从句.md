### the proof that / the reason why
- Mill answers that “the only **proof** capable of being given **that** an object is visible, is that people actually see it.
  - The proof that an object is visible，后面的或说是同位语从句。但和一般的从句和从句前词所指的是同一回事，不一样。an object is visible 是被 prove 的东西，并不是proof

### 多个定语从句并列

  - 后两个that： Russell learned (more about ..) that ..., that...。作为learned的宾语从句
- But “intuition, bound up to a duration which is growth, perceives in it an uninterrupted continuity of unforeseeable novelty; it sees, it knows **that** the mind draws from itself more than it has, **that** spirituality consists in just that, and **that** reality, impregnated with spirit, is creation.”

   - What引导宾语从句，比如“I don't know what you mean.” 

### 形容词的宾语从句：
- 宾语从句作形容词的宾语是指在复合句中，形容词后面跟着一个宾语从句，充当补足语的作用。这类形容词通常具有动词的含义，因此可以带宾语从句。例如：
  - I am sorry that I have troubled you so long.（我很抱歉我这么长时间在打扰你。）
  - I am glad that you can join us.（我很高兴你能加入我们。）
- 这一类后面的从句，有说形容词的宾语从句，有说原因状语从句

  - I am sorry that ..

### that + which 从句：that 泛指
- Moreover, each succeeding emanation（发出，发射） is the cause of the next-lower emanation, as if there were a principle at work requiring that every nature **bring into being** that which is immediately subordinate to it.
   - 关于子句 every nature bring into being **that which** is immediately subordinate to it：

     - 所以上面句子即为：every nature **bring** （that-thing which is immediately subordinate to it） **into being**
- Granted, Plato does say that “**that which** becomes must necessarily become through the agency of some cause.”
