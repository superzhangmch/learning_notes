关于 deepseek-v3 的 fp8 训练的背景介绍，原文摘录如下（3.3节 《FP8 Training》）：

> Inspired by recent advances in low-precision training（见下面引文A,B,C）, we propose a fine-grained mixed precision framework utilizing the FP8
data format for training DeepSeek-V3.

> （1）、we introduce a fine-grained quantization strategy: tile-wise grouping with 1 × 𝑁𝑐 elements or block-wise grouping with 𝑁𝑐 × 𝑁𝑐 elements. The associated dequantization overhead is largely mitigated under our increased-precision accumulation process, a critical aspect for achieving accurate FP8 General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM).

> （2）、Moreover, to further reduce memory and communication overhead in MoE training, we cache and dispatch activations in FP8, while storing low-precision optimizer states in BF16.
>
> （3）、We validate the proposed FP8 mixed precision framework on two model scales similar to DeepSeek-V2-Lite and DeepSeekV2, training for approximately 1 trillion tokens (see more details in Appendix B.1). Notably, compared with the BF16 baseline, the relative loss error of our FP8-training model remains consistently below 0.25%, a level well within the acceptable range of training randomness.
