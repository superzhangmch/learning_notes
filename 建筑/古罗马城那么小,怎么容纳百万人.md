**Population density of ancient cities** was often extremely high by modern standards, especially inside city walls. Estimates vary because ancient censuses were rare, but historians and archaeologists combine texts, housing footprints, and urban area measurements to infer ranges.

## Typical density ranges (people per km²)

| City / Period                      |     Estimated Density | Notes                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rome (c. 1st–2nd century CE)**   | **40,000–60,000/km²** | Multi-story *insulae* (apartment blocks); peak population ~1 million |
| **Alexandria (Hellenistic–Roman)** | **30,000–50,000/km²** | Dense core, major port city                                          |
| **Athens (Classical period)**      | **20,000–40,000/km²** | Walled city plus crowded residential quarters                        |
| **Babylon (Neo-Babylonian)**       | **20,000–30,000/km²** | Large ceremonial spaces reduce average density                       |
| **Chang’an (Tang dynasty)**        | **10,000–20,000/km²** | Planned grid with wards; density varied by ward                      |
| **Tenochtitlan (Aztec)**           | **20,000–40,000/km²** | Island city; canals increased usable space                           |
| **Medieval European cities**       | **15,000–50,000/km²** | Narrow streets; wooden multi-story houses                            |

## Why densities were so high

* **Defensive walls** constrained expansion.
* **Limited transport** meant people lived close to work and markets.
* **Vertical building** (especially Rome) increased capacity.
* **Minimal open space** inside walls (few parks, small courtyards).

## Important caveats

* Densities often reflect **intra-mural areas only**; suburbs were less dense.
* Estimates can differ by **2× or more** depending on assumptions.
* Elite districts and ceremonial zones lower citywide averages; **residential blocks** could be much denser.

### Quick comparison

For context, **modern Manhattan** averages ~28,000/km², while **Manila** exceeds 40,000/km²—comparable to the densest ancient cities.

If you want, I can break this down **by civilization**, **by century**, or compare **ancient vs. modern megacities** in more detail.
