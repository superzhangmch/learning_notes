# 定语
----
### 形容词作后置定语的三种情况
1. 形容词短语作定语时要后置。如：
  - I think he is a man suitable for the job. 
  - We need a place twice larger than this one.
  - Most Britons agree that Lords is an anachronism（不合时宜，过时之物） ripe for reform but cannot agree on what to do with it.
    - 注意这里 ripe for 后置
2. 表语形容词作定语要后置。
  - He spoke like a man afraid. 
  - He must be the best violinist alive. 
3. 受修饰复合不定代词时后置。
  - Tell me something interesting. 
  - Anyone intelligent can do it. 

### 不定式做定语
  - Even that would not invalidate Hegel’s claim **to have described the only genuine form of freedom**

### 介词短语作定语
- Another method is to invoke authority , as when people **in authority** require the acceptance of certain ideas under threat of punishment. 
  - people in authority == poeple **that are** in autority

### nothing/something 的定语后置
- He thinks **nothing empirical** is knowable. 没有什么经验之物是可认知的。也就是经验之事物不可认知。
  - Nothing empirical ，nothing 为代词，按“没有什么”来翻译。形容词修饰nothing /something时后置。
  - 再如 Nothing empirical can ever be proven or disproven by logical argument alone. 没什么经验之物能被仅仅逻辑来验证。

### 动词被动式当定语（过去分词短语作定语）
- US citizens caught in Virginia’s voter purge aimed at noncitizens speak out.
  - US citizens (who are caught in Virginia’s voter purge (which is aimed at noncitizens ) speak out
    - 两个被动式嵌套
  - voter purge：purge为名词。选民清洗行动
  - 这里的理解难点是：难道不应该是 voter purge which aimed at noncitizens 吗? 难道不是 voter purge=主语 aimed at=谓语 noncitizens=宾语吗？关于此，AI解释：在这句话中，“aimed at noncitizens”实际上仍然是一个被动结构。虽然字面上看起来像是“voter purge”在“aim at”非公民，但这里的“aimed”是过去分词，表示“voter purge”本身是被设计或被制定来针对非公民的。这是一种常见的表达方式，用于描述目的或目标。
    - 看几个例句：
      - my criticism **wasn't aimed** at you. 改成主动语态是：I didn’t aim my criticism at you.
      - these measures **are aimed** at preventing violent crime.
    
- There is in fact no way to agree or disagree with a conclusion **arrived at by means of the first three methods**. 
  -  ==.. a conclusion **that is arrived at** by  ..
   - 被动语态当定语。比如：The book **written by J.K. Rowling** has become a bestseller.
- the third natural law Hobbes speaks of is “that men perform their covenants made”.
  - 解释：... that men perform their covenants(盟约) **that have been** made
- These odd behaviors were just a few of several anomalies that scientists **stationed (被动式)** at the Riverbanks Zoo and Garden in Columbia, South Carolina, observed during the historic solar event spanning the United States, according to a March 2020 report. 
  - be stationed at/in 
- You may do well to take notice of all pious doctrines among foreigners, as far as they are grounded on common reason, and concur with the precepts of a 【morally】 good life, **taught** in our church. 
  - 后半句是 concur  with the same precepts which are taught in our church.

# 主语
----
### 不定式做主语
  - **To have such knowledge** involves, in various sequences, sensation, imagination, and memory, as well as the capacity of intuitive synthesis. 
    - involve in 短语，涉及到。作谓语。

### it 形式主语
- It does not make any difference **how many snapshots my visual or auditory camera takes of external things**.
  - It 形式主语，后面的主语从句是真正主语

- Sociology, psychology and anthropology teach that man is to be regarded as an object concerning which something can be learnt that will make **it possible to modify** this object by deliberate organization. 
  - Sociology ... teach that man is to be regarded as an object (concerning which something (that【指something】 will make it【形式主语】 possible to modify this object by deliberate organization) can be learnt ) 
  - concerning： 关于，about sth; involving sth

- **It** is the function of logical analysis, he said, **to analyze **all knowledge, all assertions of science and of everyday life, in order to make clear the sense of each assertion and the connections between
them.
  - 这句话理解上是：the function of logical analysis is to analyze ...
  - 而字面上是： to analyze .. is the function of logical analysis. （当然，A is B，B is A等价吧）

- How much easier it is to agree on the uses of words or even on how to reach agreement. 

- Far more serious was Augustine’s awareness that it did not help to solve his moral turmoil to say that it was all caused by some external force.
  - （to say that it was all caused by some external force=主语） （did not help=谓语） to solve his moral turmoil

### XXX-ever 作主语
- Yes, Wittgenstein has been a great event in my life—**whatever** may become of it.
  - whatever可做主语。
  - become of: 发生在……身上。”whatever may become of it“：无论会有什么发生在it身上。

### what 主语从句
- what appear to be disjointed events and contradictory forces are in reality intimately harmonized
- what is in opposition is in concert, and from what differs comes the most beautiful harmony.

# 形容词当名词
----
- to make it as sensible as **the sensible**
  - 即 to make it as sensible as **the sensible things**

# to have done ..
- His rosy description of the Germany of his own day, coupled with his statement that the progress of the idea of freedom has now reached its consummation, can only mean that he believes his own country, in his own times, to **have (believe … to have done …) achieved** the status of a rationally organized society.
- “We have seen that Hegel believes all the events of the past to **have been leading** up to the goal of freedom.”

# which 指代前面整句话
- The White House publicly authorized Ukraine Sunday to fire missiles it supplied into Russia proper, which it swiftly did Monday. 
  - 解释: Russia proper 俄核心领土，本土。which 指代前面整句话。

# 名词性从句：充当的是名词角色
- It is essential to my view,” Rorty writes, “that we have no pre-linguistic consciousness to which language needs to be adequate, no deep sense of **how things are** which it is the duty of philosophers to spell out in language.”
  - it is essential that we have no ..., no ...
  - be adequate to: 足够胜任，能够满足要求. 没有需要语言去胜任去适应的.... 几个AI都翻译为“适应/适配”
  - 后半句 which == deep sense of how things are = deep sense of noun. 充当 to spell out 的宾语（to spell out which) 
    - deep sense of how things are：how things are 为名词性从句。

# 虚拟语态
- If it had not been for the supplemental package, Ukrainians would be in a much worse situation right now.

- “Had this always been the case, it would have been more difficult for those who regarded themselves as socialists to have justified the crimes of Stalin on the grounds that the ends justified the means. ”
  - 如果情况一直如此，那些自认为是社会主义者的人就更难以目的证明手段正当为理由为斯大林的罪行辩护。

- the human race will not be free of evils until either the stock of those who rightly and truly follow philosophy acquire political authority, or the class who have power in the cities be led by some divine intervention to become real philosophers.
  - Either.. Or..: .. until **either** the stock of those who ..., **or** the class ... be led by some divine intervention to become real philosophers.
  - 后半句 be led 是谓语。为啥不是 are led？因为是虚拟语态。
  - 用 be 原形的例句：
    - 建议: It is essential that every student be given equal opportunities to succeed.
    - 愿望: I wish that I be assigned to the London office.
    - 强烈建议或命令: The doctor insisted that the patient be admitted to the hospital immediately.
    - 条件句（尤其是与现实相反的情况）: If I were you, I would suggest that she be told the truth.
    - 假设: Suppose that you be chosen for the role, how would you prepare?

- "Suppose you were to have a child" VS "Suppose you will have a child"
  - Suppose you were to have a child
    - 语气：假设、虚拟语气，用于表达一种不太可能或假想的情况。
    - 意思：如果你将来有个孩子会怎么样？这里的重点是“假设”，带有一种不确定性或与现实的脱离。
    - 中文：假如你有一个孩子（但其实你不一定会有孩子，或者这是个完全假想的情景）。
  - Suppose you will have a child
    - 语气：陈述或假设一种将来可能发生的事实，更贴近现实。
    - 意思：假设你以后会有一个孩子，这可能是一个实际的计划或预期中的事情。
    - 中文：假设你以后会有一个孩子（更倾向于一种可能性，认为你确实可能会有孩子）。

假设：
- “None of them, it was constantly asserted, would support their own governments should such a war break out.”

# 宾语补足语
- ‘We hold the US responsible,’ says brother of Iraqi student killed in airstrikes 
  - 我们认为美国要负责任
  -  “We hold the US responsible” 中，并没有明显省略任何成分。这是一个完整的句子，包含主语“We”（我们），动词“hold”（认为），宾语“the US”（美国），以及宾语补足语“responsible”（负责）

# 疑问词
### where 前不用介词。用了也不算错
在正式或书面语中，有时会使用 介词 + where 来表达更具体的地点或方向。
- "At where": 表示特定位置，不常见，多用于口语或非正式语境。 e.g. The shop is at where the two streets meet. (不常用，通常会说 "The shop is where the two streets meet.")
- "In where": 表示某一内部空间，也不常见，多数情况下可以省略 "in"。 e.g. This is the city in where I was born. (更常用：This is the city where I was born.)
- "To where": 表示去某地，比单独的 "where" 更加强调方向。 e.g. I am going to where my family lives.
- "From where": 表示来源地，用法很常见。 e.g. This is the town from where I moved.

大部分情况下，"where" 本身就可以表达地点概念，所以介词往往是多余的。尤其在现代英语中，许多形式会简化，比如：
- 错误： This is the place in where I met her.
- 正确： This is the place where I met her.

两个句子 “Where does this road lead?” 和 “Where does this road lead to?” 都是正确的，不过它们的用法和风格上稍有不同：
1. Where does this road lead? 这是更正式、更简洁的表达方式。
  - "Lead" 本身已经包含了指向某个地方的意义，所以不需要额外的介词 "to"。
  - 常用于正式场合或书面语中。
2. Where does this road lead to?这是更常见的口语表达方式。
  - "Lead to" 是一个常用搭配，强调 "通往" 或 "到达" 某处。
  - 在非正式交流中，使用 "lead to" 更自然。

# 存古
- How **comes** it to be furnished?
  - 为什么不是 how does it come to be furnished? 
    - “How comes it to be furnished?” 是一种较为古典或文雅的英语表达方式。虽然现代英语中更常用 “How does it come to be furnished?”，两者在意义上是相同的。
    - 在历史上，英语中有些动词在疑问句或否定句中可以直接加 -s，而不使用助动词 “do”。这种用法在现代英语中已经不太常见，但在一些固定表达、文学作品或较为正式的场合中可能仍会看到。
    - 因此，虽然 “How does it come to be furnished?” 是更常见和现代的表达方式，但原句 “How comes it to be furnished?” 并没有语法错误，只是反映了英语的一个较为古老的用法。
    - 再如：
      - “What think you?” - 相当于现代英语中的 “What do you think?”。
      - “Know you the answer?” - 等同于 “Do you know the answer?”。
      - “Sees he the truth?” - 相当于 “Does he see the truth?”。
      - “What say you?” - 意思是 “What do you say?”，仍然偶尔在法律或正式场合中使用。
      - 这些表达方式在现代使用中可能显得古雅或正式，通常用于创造一种特定的语气或风格，而不是日常对话中的标准用法。在当代英语中，使用助动词 “do” 更为普遍和符合语法规范。

- if any one will examine himself concerning his notion of pure substance in general, he will find he has no other idea of it at all, but only a supposition of he **knows not** what support of such qualities which are capable of producing simple ideas in us.
  - Know not 古英语中的doesn’t know
  - “he knows not” 是一种古典或诗意的表达方式，在现代英语中通常会用 “he does not know” 来表达相同的意思。这种句式省略了助动词 “do” 并直接使用动词的否定形式，这在现代标准英语中较为少见，但在古英语、早期现代英语以及一些文学作品中较为常见。
  - 这种结构在莎士比亚的作品和圣经的某些版本中也可以看到。例如：
    - “He knows not the ways of the world.” - 相当于 “He does not know the ways of the world.”

- What confers on a person the attributes of morality is that these elements are the ingredients of free acts. 
  - （What confers on a person the attributes of morality）is that （these elements are the ingredients of free acts）.
  - 主语表语都是从句 

# 动词后的不定式省却to


情态动词后不带 to，自不待言。

### 1. 不需要带 to 的不定式动词：

#### 使役动词（某些用法）：let, make, have
  - She made me cry.
  - But since they looked upon truth as a relative matter, they were eventually accused of teaching young citizens how to **make** a bad case **look** good or to make the unjust cause appear to be just.
    - make sb/sth do ..， 而非 make 。。 sb/sth to do

#### 感官动词（某些用法）：see, hear, feel, watch, notice 等（表示完整动作时省略 to）
  - 例如：I saw her leave the house.

1. 表示完整动作时，不能带 to（必须用原形动词）： 表示你观察到整个动作的过程。
  - I saw him leave the room. （看到他离开房间，完整动作）
  - She heard me sing a song. （她听到我唱了一首歌）
  - 注意：这里不可以加 to，只能用原形动词。

2. 表示正在发生的动作（部分动作），必须用动词-ing 形式：如果感官动词强调“正在进行中的动作”，要用动名词形式（-ing）。
  - I saw him leaving the room. （看到他正在离开房间）
  - She heard me singing a song. （她听到我正在唱歌）

### 2. 可以带 to 也可以省略的动词：
 - help 是一个特殊动词，可以接不定式时带 to 或不带 to，两者都正确。
  - 例如：She helped me (to) finish the project.
  - 不过美式英语中更倾向于省略 to。
