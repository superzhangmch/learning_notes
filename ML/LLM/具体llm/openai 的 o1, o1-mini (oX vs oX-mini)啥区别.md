o1 vs o1-mini,  o3 vs o3-mini, 乃至  o3-mini 还有三个：low，high， medium。他们背后怎么做的？

oX与oX-mini, 是背后一个模型，训出多个推理等级从而靠参数或prompt控制，还是mini与非mini本身就是不同大小的模型？

看一些资料，应该是这样：oX与oX-mini 背后的model size(parameter count)是不同的。但是 o4-mini 三个版本，应该是不同的靠参数或prompt控制得来的。

Got it. I’ll look into the essential differences between OpenAI’s reasoning models—specifically o1 vs o1-mini, o3 vs o3-mini, and the internal variants of o3-mini (low, medium, high). I’ll focus on aspects such as whether they share the same base architecture, how they differ in size, depth of reasoning, or system prompt configurations.

I’ll get back to you with a detailed breakdown.

# Comparison of OpenAI’s o1, o1‑mini, o3, and o3‑mini (Low/Medium/High) Reasoning Models

## Background: The O‑Series “Reasoning” Models (Project Orion)  
OpenAI’s **o-series** models (e.g. **o1**, **o3**, etc.) are a family of advanced reasoning-optimized large language models introduced starting in late 2024. Internally, this project was code-named **“Strawberry”** (for o1) and is believed to be part of OpenAI’s *Orion* model series ([OpenAIs Strawberry (o1) architecture | AIGuys](https://medium.com/aiguys/what-is-going-on-inside-openais-strawberry-o1-717773a9964b#:~:text=This%20week%20OpenAI%20released%20a,and%20the%20models%20coming%20from)). These models are distinct from prior GPT-4-based models (often dubbed GPT-4o) in that they are explicitly trained to **“think” longer and more systematically** before answering. In other words, o-series models perform deliberate multi-step reasoning (chain-of-thought) internally instead of responding with the first guess. As one OpenAI description put it, *“the o1 models think before they answer, producing a long internal chain of thought before responding to the user”* ([Introducing OpenAI o1 | Thordur Arnason](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thordur_introducing-openai-o1-activity-7240054719287619585-lqW6#:~:text=After%20experimenting%20a%20lot%20with,in%2Fd2mPnUfu%20%20and%20%2016)). This marks a new paradigm focused on problem-solving capability in domains like math, science, and coding ([OpenAI o1 explained: Everything you need to know](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/OpenAI-o1-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know#:~:text=As%20opposed%20to%20OpenAI%27s%20prior,solving%20strategies)).

Importantly, OpenAI has **not** published detailed technical papers on these models’ architecture or exact parameter counts (a typical practice for OpenAI’s commercial models) ([OpenAI's o3-mini reasoning model arrives to counter DeepSeek | VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/its-here-openais-o3-mini-advanced-reasoning-model-arrives-to-counter-deepseeks-rise/#:~:text=OpenAI%20did%20not%20provide%20any,parties%20could%20test%20it)). However, based on official communications and analyses, all o-series models use the **same fundamental Transformer architecture** (a dense Transformer network with extensive fine-tuning) and leverage reinforcement learning and specialized training for reasoning ([Comparison of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) | by Carlos E. Perez | Intuition Machine | Medium](https://medium.com/intuitionmachine/comparison-of-large-reasoning-models-lrms-dbc468d10906#:~:text=1)). The key differences between models lie in their **scale, training regimen, and how much reasoning computation they perform** – *not merely in a system prompt setting*. Below, we break down the differences between **o1**, **o1-mini**, **o3**, and **o3-mini** (including its Low/Medium/High “reasoning effort” modes), in terms of architecture, size, and usage.

## Architecture and Training Approach  
All o-series models share a common base approach: they are Transformer-based LLMs fine-tuned (with techniques like RLHF and specialized prompts) to excel at multi-step reasoning. OpenAI has described o1/o3 models as *“dense Transformer, RLHF-optimized”* models ([Comparison of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) | by Carlos E. Perez | Intuition Machine | Medium](https://medium.com/intuitionmachine/comparison-of-large-reasoning-models-lrms-dbc468d10906#:~:text=1)). This means **no fundamentally new architecture** (e.g. no Mixture-of-Experts in these models – unlike some competitors – and they remain monolithic transformers), but they **differ from standard GPT-4** in **how they’re trained and used**. Specifically, o-series models are trained to employ **chain-of-thought reasoning**, internally working through problems step by step before producing a final answer ([OpenAI o1 explained: Everything you need to know](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/OpenAI-o1-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know#:~:text=The%20basic%20strategy%20taken%20by,techniques%2C%20such%20as%20%2064)). This is reinforced via advanced fine-tuning (reportedly with reinforcement learning and possibly curated reasoning datasets) so that the model learns to “plan” or “reflect” on tough questions. 

By design, these models **spend more computation per query** than a typical model. As TechTarget explains, *“o1 models are designed to reason better… instead of just providing a response as quickly as possible…, o1 ‘thinks’ about what the right approach is to solve a problem. The o1 series spends more time processing information before responding, targeting hard problems requiring multistep reasoning”* ([OpenAI o1 explained: Everything you need to know](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/OpenAI-o1-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know#:~:text=As%20opposed%20to%20OpenAI%27s%20prior,solving%20strategies)). In practice, this involves the model generating an internal solution path or trying multiple strategies internally. This is not something a simple system prompt can achieve on a regular GPT-4 – it requires the model itself to be tuned to carry out this reflective process. In short, **the underlying architecture (Transformer) is shared with GPT-4-class models, but the *behavioral tuning* is different**. The models have additional inference-time routines and training that enable deeper reasoning beyond what a prompt alone would induce. 

Notably, OpenAI introduced new API features for these reasoning models (like *“developer messages”* and *“reasoning tokens”*) rather than relying on user-provided system prompts. For instance, system messages are treated differently: when using `o1` or `o3-mini` via API, any system message is effectively handled as a special developer instruction ([Azure OpenAI reasoning models - o3-mini, o1, o1-mini - Azure OpenAI | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/reasoning#:~:text=,in%20the%20same%20API%20request)). This indicates the models operate under a custom system prompt or policy by default – the reasoning behavior is built-in, not left to the user to prompt. Moreover, certain generation parameters (temperature, top_p, etc.) are fixed or unsupported for these models ([Azure OpenAI reasoning models - o3-mini, o1, o1-mini - Azure OpenAI | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/reasoning#:~:text=The%20following%20are%20currently%20unsupported,with%20reasoning%20models)), since the reasoning process is internally managed (often deterministically) to ensure consistency. All these factors show that **the o-series models are distinct model instances with custom fine-tuning and inference logic**, not simply GPT-4 with a different prompt.

## Model Scale and Variants: **o1 vs o1‑mini vs o3 vs o3‑mini**  
Within the o-series, OpenAI provides “full-size” models and **“mini” variants**, which differ primarily in model **size (parameter count)** and consequently cost/speed. While OpenAI hasn’t disclosed exact parameter numbers, it is clear that **`o1` is a large, high-capability model**, whereas **`o1-mini` is a smaller, more efficient version** ([OpenAI's o3-mini reasoning model arrives to counter DeepSeek | VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/its-here-openais-o3-mini-advanced-reasoning-model-arrives-to-counter-deepseeks-rise/#:~:text=The%20o3,mini)). OpenAI itself described o1-mini as a *“small version of the primary o1 model, optimized for speed and efficiency while maintaining strong performance”* ([OpenAI o1 explained: Everything you need to know](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/OpenAI-o1-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know#:~:text=o1)). In other words, o1-mini uses fewer parameters (and thus runs faster and cheaper) at the cost of some peak performance, similar to how GPT-3.5 Turbo compares to GPT-4. Early reports noted o1-mini achieves roughly “80% of the cost” of o1 for strong coding capability ([OpenAI o1: A New Model That ‘Thinks’ Before Answering Problems](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/09/openai-o1/#:~:text=%2A%20The%20o1,for%20researchers%2C%20developers%2C%20and%20educators)) and was particularly good for developers needing quick answers.

Key distinctions between **o1** and **o1-mini**:  
- **Model Size & Speed:** o1-mini has a lower parameter count (OpenAI hasn’t given numbers, but it’s explicitly a *“lower-parameter-count sibling”* of o1 ([OpenAI's o3-mini reasoning model arrives to counter DeepSeek | VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/its-here-openais-o3-mini-advanced-reasoning-model-arrives-to-counter-deepseeks-rise/#:~:text=The%20o3,mini))). This makes it faster and able to handle higher throughput, whereas o1 is more computationally intensive. For example, o1-mini’s response latency is ~12.8s per 100 tokens, and the newer o3-mini improved on even that by 24% ([OpenAI's o3-mini reasoning model arrives to counter DeepSeek | VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/its-here-openais-o3-mini-advanced-reasoning-model-arrives-to-counter-deepseeks-rise/#:~:text=Its%20performance%20is%20comparable%20to,but%20offers%20the%20following%20advantages)).  
- **Performance:** As expected, the full o1 outperforms o1-mini on the hardest tasks. OpenAI noted o1-mini produces more errors on difficult problems and was less accurate on very challenging questions ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=Similar%20to%20its%20OpenAI%20o1,evaluations%20including%20AIME%20and%20GPQA)) ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=math%2C%20coding%2C%20and%20science%2C%20while,of%20the%20most%20challenging%20reasoning)). Testers preferred full o1’s answers over o1-mini’s in many cases ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=math%2C%20coding%2C%20and%20science%2C%20while,evaluations%20including%20AIME%20and%20GPQA)). That said, o1-mini was still quite capable (surpassing older GPT-4 in some coding benchmarks) and excelled in its speed/cost tradeoff, making it useful for coding help and rapid tasks ([OpenAI o1 explained: Everything you need to know](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/OpenAI-o1-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know#:~:text=o1)).  
- **Multimodality:** The original o1 *supports image inputs*, whereas o1-mini (and the o3-mini model) do not. The full o1 inherited **vision** capabilities – it can analyze and respond to uploaded images ([OpenAI o1 explained: Everything you need to know](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/OpenAI-o1-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know#:~:text=The%20full%20o1%20model%20is,and%20respond%20to%20uploaded%20images)) ([Introducing OpenAI o1 | Thordur Arnason](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thordur_introducing-openai-o1-activity-7240054719287619585-lqW6#:~:text=Breaking%3A%20OpenAI%20releases%20their%20newest,subscribers%20will%20have%20it%20today)) – effectively integrating GPT-4V’s abilities. OpenAI explicitly recommends using o1 (not o3-mini) for visual reasoning tasks, since o3-mini *“does not support vision capabilities”* ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=specific%20use%20cases,rolling%20out%20in%20the%20Chat)). This suggests o1’s underlying model is multimodal (like GPT-4V), while the mini models are text-only. 

Now, what about **`o3` and `o3-mini`**? In January 2025 OpenAI announced **o3-mini** as *“the newest, most cost-efficient model in our reasoning series”* ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20releasing%20OpenAI%20o3%E2%80%91mini%2C%20the,reduced%20latency%20of%20OpenAI%20o1%E2%80%91mini)). Notably, o3-mini is positioned as the next-generation mini model that *matches or exceeds o1’s performance* in many areas, at lower cost. It is essentially the **“small” variant of the upcoming o3 model**. The **`o3` (full)** model itself was also previewed in late 2024, but as of early 2025 it had not been publicly released; OpenAI only opened a waitlist for testing o3, indicating it’s a larger model still in the works ([OpenAI's o3-mini reasoning model arrives to counter DeepSeek | VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/its-here-openais-o3-mini-advanced-reasoning-model-arrives-to-counter-deepseeks-rise/#:~:text=OpenAI%20did%20not%20provide%20any,parties%20could%20test%20it)). Therefore, most available info is on o3-mini and hints about o3:

- **o3 (full model):** This is expected to be a **larger, more powerful successor to o1**, presumably with an upgraded architecture or simply more parameters/fine-tuning. OpenAI has provided no detailed specs yet ([OpenAI's o3-mini reasoning model arrives to counter DeepSeek | VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/its-here-openais-o3-mini-advanced-reasoning-model-arrives-to-counter-deepseeks-rise/#:~:text=OpenAI%20did%20not%20provide%20any,parties%20could%20test%20it)). It was announced alongside o3-mini in Dec 2024 as part of the Orion series but was not immediately available to developers. Given the naming, o3 likely represents the third major iteration of the reasoning model (with “o2” being an intermediate stage or internal experiment). It’s anticipated that o3 will aim for even deeper reasoning or higher accuracy on tough benchmarks, potentially targeting state-of-the-art performance in STEM tasks. It might also eventually incorporate multimodal input, though initial indications are that vision is still handled by o1 for now ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=specific%20use%20cases,rolling%20out%20in%20the%20Chat)). In absence of official data, one can say **o3 is fundamentally a different (presumably bigger) model than o1**, not just o1 with a prompt – but we await specifics on its parameter count or architecture tweaks once OpenAI releases them.  

- **o3-mini:** This model *does* have published details. **OpenAI o3-mini is a small, fast reasoning model that achieves o1-level reasoning capability through efficiency**. It was optimized to deliver *“exceptional STEM capabilities… while maintaining the low cost and reduced latency of o1-mini”* ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20releasing%20OpenAI%20o3%E2%80%91mini%2C%20the,reduced%20latency%20of%20OpenAI%20o1%E2%80%91mini)). In other words, o3-mini’s claim to fame is **significantly improved training such that a smaller model can rival the big model’s performance on complex problems**. OpenAI reports that *“with medium reasoning effort, o3-mini matches o1’s performance in math, coding, and science, while delivering faster responses”* ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=Similar%20to%20its%20OpenAI%20o1,evaluations%20including%20AIME%20and%20GPQA)). In fact, on certain benchmarks o3-mini even surpasses o1 when allowed to “think harder” (more on reasoning effort below). This suggests that o3-mini is **not the same base as o1-mini** – it’s a new generation model, likely trained with better data or methods. It still uses a Transformer backbone, but might incorporate improved training techniques (e.g. more chain-of-thought examples, better RL fine-tuning, etc.) to punch above its weight. The model’s context window is huge (up to 200k tokens input) just like o1’s ([Azure OpenAI reasoning models - o3-mini, o1, o1-mini - Azure OpenAI | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/reasoning#:~:text=Structured%20Outputs%20%20%E2%9C%85%20%E2%9C%85,)), indicating it shares the extended context architecture of the series. 

Summarizing **model sizes and variants:** OpenAI hasn’t disclosed exact parameter counts, but **o1 and o3 (full models)** are the flagship, high-parameter models (with o3 presumably >= o1 in scale or capability), whereas **o1-mini and o3-mini** are smaller, cost-efficient versions. They **do not all share the same weights** – each is individually trained/tuned. For example, o3-mini is a distinct model from o1; OpenAI wouldn’t be able to flip a switch and turn o1 into o3-mini via prompt – it’s a new model that required training. On the other hand, **the underlying architecture remains in the same family** (all are dense Transformer decoders with similar APIs). So the relationship is analogous to having a family of related neural nets of different sizes and training intensities, all tailored for reasoning tasks. 

## Reasoning Effort Modes: **Low, Medium, High** (o3-mini) vs Standard and Pro (o1)  
One of the most important differences in how these models operate is the concept of **“reasoning effort”** or **variable inference computation**. OpenAI introduced tunable reasoning modes with o-series models to let the model effectively **“think harder”** on demand ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=OpenAI%20o1%E2%80%91mini%20and%20OpenAI%20o1%E2%80%91preview%2C,opens%20in%20a%20new)) ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=between%20three%20reasoning%20effort%20%E2%81%A0,when%20latency%20is%20a%20concern)). This is *not* a different base model, but rather a setting that changes how the model uses its compute at inference time. In the ChatGPT UI and API, OpenAI exposes these as choices like **o3-mini-low**, **o3-mini-medium**, **o3-mini-high** – all of which use the same o3-mini weights but allocate different amounts of internal reasoning. Here’s how they differ:

- **o3-mini (Medium Effort):** By default, “OpenAI o3-mini” refers to the **medium reasoning effort** mode. This is a balanced setting where the model does a moderate amount of step-by-step thinking, yielding accuracy comparable to the full o1 model on challenging tasks ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=Similar%20to%20its%20OpenAI%20o1,evaluations%20including%20AIME%20and%20GPQA)) but with faster turnaround. Medium effort is the default in ChatGPT for o3-mini, providing a good trade-off between speed and reasoning depth ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=While%20OpenAI%20o1%20remains%20our,o3%E2%80%91mini%E2%80%91high)). 

- **o3-mini-high:** This mode triggers **maximal reasoning effort**, allowing the model to take longer and pursue more extensive internal computation for each answer. The result is a **“higher-intelligence version”** of o3-mini that can outperform even the full o1 model on certain hard problems (at the cost of latency) ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=While%20OpenAI%20o1%20remains%20our,o3%E2%80%91mini%E2%80%91high)). OpenAI describes high effort as letting the model *“think harder when tackling complex challenges”*, i.e. possibly exploring multiple solution paths or self-checking answers ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=OpenAI%20o1%E2%80%91mini%20and%20OpenAI%20o1%E2%80%91preview%2C,opens%20in%20a%20new)). Empirically, o3-mini-high has achieved state-of-the-art results among OpenAI models on benchmarks: for example, it scored ~83.6% on AIME 2024 math (beating o1’s ~78%) and ~77% on PhD-level science QA (GPQA) ([DeepSeek's new model, OpenAI o3-mini, Mistral's 24B parameter model, and more - DEV Community](https://dev.to/thisweekinaiengineering/deepseeks-new-model-openai-o3-mini-mistrals-24b-parameter-model-and-more-16fi#:~:text=%2A%20STEM%20Excellence%3A%2087.3,with%20high%20reasoning%20effort)). High effort mode often closes the gap between the mini model’s smaller size and the larger model’s raw power by using extra computation – for instance, through techniques like majority voting or iterative reflection (OpenAI’s system card notes that o3-mini-high even exceeds o1 when allowed to use 64-sample consensus voting ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=performance%20with%20OpenAI%20o1%E2%80%91mini%2C%20while,consensus%29%20with%2064%20samples))). In the ChatGPT interface, “o3-mini-high” appears as a separate option for Plus users, since it may take a bit longer per response ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=While%20OpenAI%20o1%20remains%20our,o3%E2%80%91mini%E2%80%91high)). 

- **o3-mini-low:** This mode uses minimal extra reasoning – essentially a faster mode where the model does less internal deliberation. Low effort prioritizes speed/latency. As expected, o3-mini-low’s accuracy drops compared to medium: roughly on par with or slightly above o1-mini’s performance on many tasks ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=Mathematics%3A%20With%20low%20reasoning%20effort%2C,consensus%29%20with%2064%20samples)) ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=PhD,achieves%20comparable%20performance%20with%20o1)). It’s useful for simple queries or when responsiveness is critical and the questions aren’t extremely complex. Free ChatGPT users were given access to a “Reason (fast)” model which is effectively o3-mini-low for a quick taste of reasoning capabilities ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=Starting%20today%2C%20free%20plan%20users,to%20free%20users%20in%20ChatGPT)). 

This **reasoning effort triad (Low/Med/High)** is a new feature debuting with o3-mini. By contrast, the earlier o1 models did not have user-facing “effort” settings – there was just one mode for o1 and o1-mini in the API. However, OpenAI did introduce an **“o1 Pro”** mode exclusively for ChatGPT Pro subscribers, which in spirit is similar to a “high effort” mode for o1. The **o1 Pro mode** is essentially the same o1 model running with extra computation/time: *“this premium version uses additional computing power to improve performance… o1 pro mode had an 86% pass rate on AIME vs 78% for standard o1”* ([OpenAI o1 explained: Everything you need to know](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/OpenAI-o1-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know#:~:text=The%20o1%20pro%20mode%20is,for%20standard%20o1)). In practice o1 Pro would try multiple reasoning paths and even provided a progress bar for long queries ([OpenAI o1 explained: Everything you need to know](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/OpenAI-o1-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know#:~:text=The%20o1%20pro%20mode%20is,for%20standard%20o1)) ([OpenAI o1 explained: Everything you need to know](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/OpenAI-o1-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know#:~:text=Some%20queries%20can%20take%20more,queries%20to%20keep%20users%20updated)), indicating it was doing heavy lifting under the hood. So, while not labeled “o1-high”, the concept existed. We can see that OpenAI has now generalized this idea with o3-mini by allowing **three granular levels of reasoning intensity** accessible to all developers. 

**How are these modes implemented?** OpenAI hasn’t revealed exact implementation, but it’s likely that higher effort involves the model generating and examining **internal reasoning chains** or performing **multiple forward passes**. This could be via a hidden chain-of-thought that the model generates (and possibly refines) before finalizing an answer, or by generating several candidate answers and using an internal evaluator. The net effect is a boost in reliability/accuracy at the cost of more tokens or time. The fact that the API disallows manual setting of sampling parameters (like `temperature`) for o-series models ([Azure OpenAI reasoning models - o3-mini, o1, o1-mini - Azure OpenAI | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/reasoning#:~:text=The%20following%20are%20currently%20unsupported,with%20reasoning%20models)) supports this – the system probably runs a deterministic, orchestrated reasoning procedure when high effort is requested (instead of a single stochastic pass). So, these modes are much more than a stylistic difference or prompt; they reflect **different inference-time algorithms using the same base model**. 

In summary, **o3-mini-low/medium/high are not different base models, but different settings of how much the model “thinks”**. They share architecture and weights, but differ in the number of reasoning iterations or the complexity of chain-of-thought used per query. This is an important distinction: it means developers can choose speed vs accuracy without switching to an entirely different model. The system prompt alone cannot easily reproduce this effect on another model – it’s an integrated capability of o3-mini. 

## Performance and Intended Use Cases  
Because of the differences in scale and reasoning depth outlined above, each model (and mode) has slightly different performance profiles and ideal use cases:

- **OpenAI o1 (Full):** This is the **broadest and most powerful general reasoning model** in the o-series (until o3 releases). It excels at complex reasoning across domains and has the added advantage of **vision**. O1 can handle images – for example, users can upload a diagram or photo and o1 will analyze it and answer questions about it ([OpenAI o1 explained: Everything you need to know](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/OpenAI-o1-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know#:~:text=The%20full%20o1%20model%20is,and%20respond%20to%20uploaded%20images)) ([Introducing OpenAI o1 | Thordur Arnason](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thordur_introducing-openai-o1-activity-7240054719287619585-lqW6#:~:text=Breaking%3A%20OpenAI%20releases%20their%20newest,subscribers%20will%20have%20it%20today)), a capability inherited from GPT-4 with vision. It’s described as a “broader general knowledge reasoning model” ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=While%20OpenAI%20o1%20remains%20our,paid%20users%20will%20also%20have)), meaning it’s not limited to STEM – it has extensive knowledge like GPT-4. Use cases include any **difficult problem-solving or analysis task**, especially where multimodal input might be involved (e.g. analyzing charts, solving visual puzzles). It’s ideal for research questions, complex brainstorming, or any scenario where maximum reasoning depth is needed in one go. The trade-off is cost and speed: o1 is heavier, and some queries can be slow (hence the Pro mode with a progress bar) ([OpenAI o1 explained: Everything you need to know](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/OpenAI-o1-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know#:~:text=The%20o1%20pro%20mode%20is,for%20standard%20o1)). In the ChatGPT lineup, o1 has been offered to Plus/Enterprise users as the “Advanced Reasoning” option for tough queries.  

- **OpenAI o1-mini:** This model is **targeted for efficiency** – faster responses and higher throughput, while still performing strong reasoning. Its sweet spot is coding assistance and moderately hard problems. OpenAI noted o1-mini *“does particularly well at coding tasks”* ([OpenAI o1 explained: Everything you need to know](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/OpenAI-o1-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know#:~:text=o1)) and was a good choice for developers needing quick help with code generation or debugging. It can handle complex logic to an extent, but on the very hardest math or science problems it may falter more than o1. It also lacks image understanding. **Intended use cases**: developer tools, real-time assistants, or cost-sensitive scenarios where one still wants better reasoning than GPT-3.5 can provide. It’s basically the “80% solution at a fraction of the cost” model ([OpenAI o1: A New Model That ‘Thinks’ Before Answering Problems](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/09/openai-o1/#:~:text=%2A%20The%20o1,for%20researchers%2C%20developers%2C%20and%20educators)).

- **OpenAI o3 (Full, forthcoming):** Though not fully released at time of writing, o3 is expected to be the new **flagship reasoning model**. It will likely target the absolute hardest challenges in math, science, and engineering domains, possibly reaching new highs on benchmarks. If o1 was among top 500 US students on a math Olympiad qualifier ([Introducing OpenAI o1 | Thordur Arnason](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thordur_introducing-openai-o1-activity-7240054719287619585-lqW6#:~:text=Hello%2C%20world%21%20Meet%20OpenAI%20o1%2C,AIME%29%2C%20and%20exceeds)), o3 might aim even higher, for example. One can infer that o3’s **intended use** will be similar to o1 (general advanced reasoning) but with even greater depth or accuracy. It might also focus on technical and scientific queries (OpenAI hinted that o1 remains better for broad knowledge or common sense, whereas o3 might double-down on technical precision ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=While%20OpenAI%20o1%20remains%20our,o3%E2%80%91mini%E2%80%91high))). Until details emerge, one should view o3 as the big brother to o1 – likely a different model with improved reasoning algorithms or scale. 

- **OpenAI o3-mini (Low/Med/High):** The **o3-mini** model, with its adjustable modes, is geared towards **technical excellence with flexibility**. In medium or high mode it actually matches or exceeds o1 on STEM benchmarks ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=Similar%20to%20its%20OpenAI%20o1,evaluations%20including%20AIME%20and%20GPQA)) ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=Mathematics%3A%20With%20low%20reasoning%20effort%2C,consensus%29%20with%2064%20samples)), but with significantly **lower latency and cost**. This makes o3-mini extremely appealing for practical applications in coding assistants, math problem solvers, or scientific research helpers. OpenAI specifically positions o3-mini as a “specialized alternative for technical domains requiring precision and speed” ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=While%20OpenAI%20o1%20remains%20our,o3%E2%80%91mini%E2%80%91high)). For example, in coding, o3-mini high effort achieved an **Elo score of ~2073 on Codeforces** challenges (competitive programming), which is a very strong result, outperforming previous models in that category ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=Competition%20Code%20)). In math, it solves tough competition problems with ease when high effort is enabled. Therefore, **intended use cases** include: writing complex code or algorithms, solving mathematics word problems or proofs, answering academic science questions, and other **STEM-heavy tasks** where you might want the AI to really work through the answer. The availability of low mode also means o3-mini can scale down to handle simpler queries faster than o1 could, so it’s versatile. The main thing o3-mini cannot do is vision (no image input) and very broad commonsense Q&A might still be better handled by a model like GPT-4 (o1) if the question isn’t a logical puzzle but a general knowledge query. In practice, ChatGPT now offers o3-mini to even free users in a limited way for reasoning queries ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=Starting%20today%2C%20free%20plan%20users,to%20free%20users%20in%20ChatGPT)), signifying its importance as a fast-but-smart model. 

To put their **performance in perspective**, consider a few documented comparisons: with **medium effort**, o3-mini achieves parity with o1 on challenging exams like AIME (American Invitational Math Exam) and even PhD-level science questions ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=Similar%20to%20its%20OpenAI%20o1,evaluations%20including%20AIME%20and%20GPQA)). With high effort, o3-mini surpassed o1’s accuracy on those, closing the gap to human expert level on some tests ([DeepSeek's new model, OpenAI o3-mini, Mistral's 24B parameter model, and more - DEV Community](https://dev.to/thisweekinaiengineering/deepseeks-new-model-openai-o3-mini-mistrals-24b-parameter-model-and-more-16fi#:~:text=%2A%20STEM%20Excellence%3A%2087.3,with%20high%20reasoning%20effort)). Meanwhile, o1 (standard mode) had already outperformed the original GPT-4 in those domains – e.g., o1 ranks in the 89th percentile on Codeforces and exceeded human PhD accuracy in some science benchmarks ([Introducing OpenAI o1 | Thordur Arnason](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thordur_introducing-openai-o1-activity-7240054719287619585-lqW6#:~:text=Hello%2C%20world%21%20Meet%20OpenAI%20o1%2C,AIME%29%2C%20and%20exceeds)). So all these models represent **top-tier reasoning ability**, but o3-mini achieves those results with a smaller model through clever computation. In contrast, o1-mini, while very capable, would lag behind on the absolute toughest tasks (OpenAI found o3-mini yields *39% fewer major errors on difficult real-world questions* than o1-mini ([OpenAI's o3-mini reasoning model arrives to counter DeepSeek | VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/its-here-openais-o3-mini-advanced-reasoning-model-arrives-to-counter-deepseeks-rise/#:~:text=specific%20number%20here%2C%20but%20looking,when%20using%20high%20reasoning%20effort))). 

Another practical distinction is **context length**: Both o1 and o3-mini support extremely large context windows (up to 200K tokens of input, and 100K tokens output) ([Azure OpenAI reasoning models - o3-mini, o1, o1-mini - Azure OpenAI | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/reasoning#:~:text=Structured%20Outputs%20%20%E2%9C%85%20%E2%9C%85,)), far beyond the typical 8K or 32K of GPT-4. This enables analyzing long documents or extensive codebases in one go. O1-preview and o1-mini initially had 128K input limits ([Azure OpenAI reasoning models - o3-mini, o1, o1-mini - Azure OpenAI | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/reasoning#:~:text=Structured%20Outputs%20%20%E2%9C%85%20%E2%9C%85,)), which was already huge, and o1/o3-mini expanded it further. Such long context support suggests a shared underlying architecture upgrade (likely efficient attention mechanisms to handle 100k+ tokens). It’s not just a prompt change – the model needed engineering to handle that length. This is a feature where all o-series models differ from earlier GPT models and is part of why they are seen as a new class of LLMs for tasks like lengthy contract analysis or multi-document comparison ([Azure OpenAI reasoning models - o3-mini, o1, o1-mini - Azure OpenAI | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/reasoning#:~:text=,managing%20workflows%20requiring%20shorter%20contexts)).

## Conclusion  
In essence, **OpenAI’s o1 and o3 families are new specialized models rather than mere prompt presets applied to GPT-4.** They all build on the transformer foundation, but each represents a different balance of size, speed, and training focus. The *“mini”* variants are smaller models geared for efficiency, while the main o1/o3 models are larger for maximum capability (with o3 poised to extend the frontier). Their superior reasoning ability comes from how they were fine-tuned (with chain-of-thought and possibly new reinforcement learning techniques) and how they allocate computation at inference (via the reasoning effort mechanism). This is why, for example, o1 was **“not meant to be a drop-in replacement for GPT-4o”**, but rather a model that *“spends time thinking… and excels at science, coding, and math”* ([Introducing OpenAI o1 | Thordur Arnason](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thordur_introducing-openai-o1-activity-7240054719287619585-lqW6#:~:text=Hello%2C%20world%21%20Meet%20OpenAI%20o1%2C,AIME%29%2C%20and%20exceeds)) – it has a different usage ethos and strengths, born from a different fine-tuning regime. Likewise, o3-mini isn’t just a GPT-3.5 with a clever prompt; it’s a carefully trained model that can, with deliberation, equal a much larger model’s performance ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=Similar%20to%20its%20OpenAI%20o1,evaluations%20including%20AIME%20and%20GPQA)).

To summarize the **essential differences**:  
- **Base Architecture:** All are transformer-based LLMs (no novel architecture change). However, they are *separately fine-tuned models*, not the exact same base model across the board. OpenAI has kept architecture details and parameter counts proprietary ([Comparison of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) | by Carlos E. Perez | Intuition Machine | Medium](https://medium.com/intuitionmachine/comparison-of-large-reasoning-models-lrms-dbc468d10906#:~:text=%2A%20Architecture%3A%20Dense%20Transformer%2C%20RLHF,STEM%20Research%2C%20API%20Function%20Calling)), but o-series models are clearly distinct instances optimized for reasoning.  
- **Model Size:** *o1 vs o1-mini* and *o3 vs o3-mini* represent large vs small model pairs. The mini versions have fewer parameters (hence lower latency and cost), while the full versions have higher capacity (and include extras like multimodal input in o1’s case). This is a fundamental difference in capability and is more than just a prompt tweak ([OpenAI's o3-mini reasoning model arrives to counter DeepSeek | VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/its-here-openais-o3-mini-advanced-reasoning-model-arrives-to-counter-deepseeks-rise/#:~:text=The%20o3,mini)).  
- **Reasoning Depth:** The series introduces **internal reasoning steps**. Rather than outputting the first completion, these models internally generate chains-of-thought. This behavior is baked into the model via training (and exposed via modes in o3-mini). By contrast, a standard GPT-4 would only produce step-by-step reasoning if explicitly prompted, and even then would not “reflect” on it in the same way. O-models can inherently do things like self-check answers or backtrack on errors ([Introducing OpenAI o1 | Thordur Arnason](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thordur_introducing-openai-o1-activity-7240054719287619585-lqW6#:~:text=Hello%2C%20world%21%20Meet%20OpenAI%20o1%2C,AIME%29%2C%20and%20exceeds)), which comes from fine-tuning and (for high effort) multiple inference passes.  
- **System Prompts vs Fine-tuning:** The differences we see (e.g. o1’s reasoning ability or o3-mini’s modes) are **primarily due to fine-tuning and custom inference algorithms**, not due to static system prompts. All evidence suggests these models share the GPT-4 era architecture but have different weights/training. For instance, one cannot turn GPT-4 into o1 just by a prompt – o1 was trained with RL to have an internal chain-of-thought ([Introducing OpenAI o1 | Thordur Arnason](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thordur_introducing-openai-o1-activity-7240054719287619585-lqW6#:~:text=After%20experimenting%20a%20lot%20with,in%2Fd2mPnUfu%20%20and%20%2016)). The *system card* and API usage show that o-series expect a different input format (using developer messages) and ignore typical sampling parameters, meaning their behavior is governed by their design rather than caller-provided prompts ([Azure OpenAI reasoning models - o3-mini, o1, o1-mini - Azure OpenAI | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/reasoning#:~:text=,in%20the%20same%20API%20request)) ([Azure OpenAI reasoning models - o3-mini, o1, o1-mini - Azure OpenAI | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/reasoning#:~:text=The%20following%20are%20currently%20unsupported,with%20reasoning%20models)).  
- **Performance and Use Cases:** Each model fills a niche. **o1** is a multi-talented reasoner with broad knowledge and vision – great for complex, cross-disciplinary tasks or any scenario needing image understanding ([OpenAI o1 explained: Everything you need to know](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/OpenAI-o1-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know#:~:text=The%20full%20o1%20model%20is,and%20respond%20to%20uploaded%20images)). **o1-mini** offers faster yet fairly strong reasoning, ideal for coding support and quick-turnaround tasks ([OpenAI o1 explained: Everything you need to know](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/OpenAI-o1-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know#:~:text=o1)). **o3-mini** (Medium/High) reaches o1-level and beyond on STEM problems, making advanced reasoning more accessible in real time ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=Similar%20to%20its%20OpenAI%20o1,evaluations%20including%20AIME%20and%20GPQA)); with Low mode, it can also serve simpler questions extremely fast. **o3** (full) will presumably take the mantle for the hardest problems once released. 

In conclusion, **these models do not just differ by a system prompt—they represent different *scales* and *approaches* to advanced reasoning**. OpenAI’s o-series is essentially carving out a line of *“reasoning-optimized” LLMs* with internal mechanisms for problem solving. While they all share the transformer DNA, their capabilities are tiered by model size and inference strategy. The names (o1, o3, etc.) reflect an internal evolution (Orion project) rather than mere configurations. With official sources highlighting their unique training and the introduction of reasoning effort dials, it’s clear that the o-series is about novel *model behavior* (long-chain reasoning) achieved through intensive fine-tuning and possibly increased context usage ([OpenAI o1 explained: Everything you need to know](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/OpenAI-o1-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know#:~:text=The%20basic%20strategy%20taken%20by,techniques%2C%20such%20as%20%2064)) ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=between%20three%20reasoning%20effort%20%E2%81%A0,when%20latency%20is%20a%20concern)), rather than a trivial rebranding of an existing model. Each subsequent iteration (from o1 to o3 and beyond) is expected to bring improvements in that reasoning paradigm, pushing the frontier of what smaller or smarter models can do in domains that demand deep thought ([OpenAI o3-mini | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20releasing%20OpenAI%20o3%E2%80%91mini%2C%20the,reduced%20latency%20of%20OpenAI%20o1%E2%80%91mini)).
