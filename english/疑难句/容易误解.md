### 容易误解

- Over the next six weeks, a staggering 400 million people are expected to attend the Maha Kumbh Mela, or the festival of the Sacred Pitcher, on the riverbanks in the city of Prayagraj.
  - staggering：大的惊人的，而非摇摇晃晃/蹒跚**止步不前**的。

- As Iran and the United States hold a second round of high-stakes nuclear talks in Rome, hopes for de-escalation are being **tempered** by mounting military threats and mixed messages.
  - temper: 减轻。而不是火上浇油

- Taking the scriptural(圣经) name for God given to Moses, namely, “I Am That I Am,” Augustine interpreted this to mean that God is being itself.
  - 上帝把他的名字展示给了Moses，所以说 given to Moses, 展示给 Moses. 并不是 given by Moses， 也不是 gode给 Moses起了 Moses这个名字

- But he was not happy in that teaching position, and, strangely enough, he urged the young scholars who were influenced by his teaching not to go into teaching themselves. Instead, he urged them to undetake some physical or manual work. 
  - 解释：not to go into teaching themselves，指的是别去亲自作teaching（别误解成教自己），而要去干活

- His mother died a few days after his birth, and his father, a watchmaker, **left** him at age 10 **in the care** of an aunt, who raised him. 
  - 后半句，他爸在他十岁时把它留给aunt养。而非为照顾aunt离开他
  - leave sb/sth 某状态。固定用法

- At this level I experience the world simply as a solid, massive, undifferentiated, single something that is not yet separated into individual things. Sartre describes this type of consciousness in Nausea where the character Roquentin is sitting on a park bench. He looks at all the things before him in the park, and all at once he sees everything differently, **everything as a single thing** - "Suddenly existence had unveiled itself."
  - 这句话中：he sees everything differently, everything as a single thing。见词典：everything==all things。所以是把all things 看做了一个thing
  - 不应理解成：everything 是任意事物中的一个，从而单个怎么看做a single thing吗

- Language consists in part, then, of words, which in their simplest form refer to a particular thing and its predicate, as, for example, a red rose. 
  - Language consists （in part, then,） of words, which ...
  - 这里用的是短语 consist of，而非 consist in

- The metaphysician is treated no longer as a criminal but as a patient: there may be good reasons why he says the strange things he does. 
  - 这里 does：he does 为了强调他确实说了奇怪的事。he does say strange things. 而非用来代替 say

- costing him a popular vote win 
  - 没赢得popular vote普选。在这句“costing him a popular vote win”中，“cost”作为动词使用，意思是“导致某人失去”或“使某人付出代价”。在这里，它指的是某件事情或某种情况导致他失去了赢得普选的机会。所以，“cost”在这里表达的是一种负面的结果或代价。

- “In general, the male-dominated labour movements tended to view those who advanced **such ideas as** middle-class feminists, whose preoccupations had no relevance for most women.”
  - 一般来说，男性主导的劳工运动倾向于将那些提倡这种观点的人视为中产阶级女性主义者，他们的关注点对大多数女性来说并不具有相关性。
  - 这里的such .. as 只是凑巧在一起

- A chainsaw amnesty is protecting the rainforest in Borneo.
  - Amnesty 是赦免。
  - 整体意思却是: 现在对持有chainsaw赦免，所以请上交的意思。否则就是非法持有了

- What gives life to certain kinds of bodies?
  - 什么把生命赋予了certain kinds of bodies？乃 give sth to sb 结构的正常使用

- We show that all combinations of paired data are not necessary to train such a joint embedding, and only image-paired data is sufficient to bind the modalities together.
  - We show that **all** combinations of paired data are **not** necessary to train such a joint embedding == We show that **not all** combinations of paired data are necessary to train such a joint embedding. 
  - 不需要all paired data, image-paired data就可以
  - 不应该误解为：“所有的...都不..."

- US citizens caught in Virginia’s voter purge aimed at noncitizens speak out.
  - US citizens (who are caught in Virginia’s voter purge (which is aimed at noncitizens ) speak out
    - 两个被动式嵌套
  - voter purge：purge为名词。选民清洗行动
  - 这里容易误解的是：难道不应该是 voter purge **which （没有is）aimed at** noncitizens 吗? 难道不是 voter purge=主语 aimed at=谓语 noncitizens=宾语吗？关于此，AI解释：在这句话中，“aimed at noncitizens” 实际上仍然是一个被动结构。虽然字面上看起来像是“voter purge”在“aim at”非公民，但这里的“aimed”是过去分词，表示“voter purge”本身是**被设计或被制定来针对非公民的**。这是一种常见的表达方式，用于描述目的或目标。
    - 看几个例句：
      - my criticism **wasn't aimed** at you. 改成主动语态是：I didn’t aim my criticism at you.
      - these measures **are aimed** at preventing violent crime.

- The only safe attitude to take is one of doubt about the absolute truth of any idea.
  - （The only safe attitude to take）is one （of doubt）（about the absolute truth of any idea）.
  - 相当于这样：（The only safe attitude to take）is one （which is of doubt）（about the absolute truth of any idea）.
  - 不应理解陈 one of many ..
  - doubt about 不应该连起来理解，那样就成了 doubt 是动词了
